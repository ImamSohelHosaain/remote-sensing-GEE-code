  abstract = {In this study we evaluated several Earth observation methodologies for automatically delineating crop field boundaries from multi-temporal Sentinel-2 imagery. The methodology makes use of edge detection that is applied to multiple images acquired during a growing season and image segmentation to delimit agricultural fields, orchards and vineyards. Two edge detection operators (Canny and Scharr) and three image segmentation algorithms (watershed, multi-threshold and multi-resolution) were combined and evaluated, resulting in six experiments (scenarios). A rule-based (knowledge-based) classification was applied to the extracted image objects to discard uncultivated areas. Reference field boundaries, manually digitised from very high (10 cm) resolution aerial imagery, were used for quantitative accuracy assessments and qualitative comparisons. The quantitative accuracy assessment consisted of both area- and edge-based metrics. The results showed that the watershed segmentation, combined with Canny edge detection, produced the most accurate field boundaries with an OA of 92.9% and combined MAE of 24.5 m. The Scharr algorithm produced thicker edges, causing positional errors along the boundaries. The multi-resolution and multi-threshold segmentation algorithms produced boundary inaccuracies ranging from 1 to 3 pixels, largely due to the creation of thick boundary objects, which caused offsets of the extracted borders on both sides of the reference boundaries. The combination of Canny edge detection (performed on multiple Sentinel-2 images acquired during the growing season) and watershed segmentation is thus recommended for operational field boundary delineation.}

  abstract = {Human-mediated climate change over the past century has resulted in significant impacts to global ecosystems and biodiversity including accelerating redistribution of the geographic ranges of species. In mountainous regions, the transition zone from continuous closed-canopy montane forests to treeless alpine tundra areas at higher elevations is commonly referred to as the “alpine treeline ecotone” (ATE). Globally, warming climate is expected to drive ATEs upslope, which could lead to negative impacts on local biodiversity and changes in ecosystem function. However, existing studies rely primarily on field-based data which are difficult and time consuming to collect. In this study, we define an ATE-detection index (ATEI) to automatically identify the ATE positions from 2009 to 2011 in the western United States using geospatial tools and remotely sensed datasets provided by Google Earth Engine. A binomial logistic regression model was fitted between standardized ATEI components and a binary variable of pixel status of 141 sampled Landsat pixels manually classified with high-resolution imagery in Google Earth. The average model accuracy was around 0.713 (±0.111) and the average Kappa coefficient was approximately 0.426 (±0.221) based on a 100-time repeated 10-fold cross-validation. Furthermore, the ATEI-estimated elevation is highly correlated (Pearson's r = 0.98) with a published set of field-collected ATE elevations at 22 sampling sites across the region. The detection metric developed in this study facilitates monitoring the geographic location and potential shifts of ATEs as well as the general impact of climate change in mountainous areas during recent decades. We also expect this approach to be useful in monitoring other ecosystem boundaries.}
