# Chapter 2 - Beginner Workflows

This book provides text and examples for how to use Google Earth Engine to work through the remote sensing data workflow:

* Acquisition and Pre-Processing;
* Processing;
* Post-Processing;
* Visualization; and,
* Export.

The book includes code in `JavaScript` and `Python` languages for completing remote sensing analyses.

Chapter 2 (beginner) provides introductory modules and activities to introduce Earth Engine functionality. Each example show a few tasks and processes to familiarize the reader with the Earth Engine platform and syntax.

Chapter 3 (intermediate) provides workflows that piece together the tasks and processed from Chapter 2, in order to create more complex and meaningful workflows.

Chapter 4 (advanced) provides full scientific workflows in Earth Engine that have been re-created from existing, peer-reviewed papers. One of the goals of this book to promote and provide open and reproducible science workflows, and this section is chapter is dedicated to creating this type of workflow within the Earth Engine platform.
